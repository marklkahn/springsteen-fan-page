    <p>Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen is an American singer-songwriter, known for his work with the E Street Band. Nicknamed
        "The Boss", he is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, Americana, working class, sometimes political sentiments
        centered on his native New Jersey, his distinctive voice, and his lengthy and energetic stage performancesâ€”with concerts
        from the 1970s to the present decade running at up to four hours in length.</p>
